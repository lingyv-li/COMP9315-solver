# COMP9315-solver

A set of "solvers" for data structures and algorithms taught in UNSW COMP9315 Database Systems Implementation (2023 T1).

I wrote them to help me understand the algorithms, and I am sharing them hoping that it can help others.

## Prerequisites

Python 3 is required.

Some programs requires extra dependencies, install them with:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contribution

Contributions are very welcomed. Feel free to send PRs to improve, fix bugs or add new "solvers".
